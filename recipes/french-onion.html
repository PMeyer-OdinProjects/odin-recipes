    <h1>Julia Child's French Onion Soup</h1>
    <img src="images/french-onion-soup.jpg" alt="A bowl of French onion soup" height=400px widht=450px>
    <p>Julia Child, no introduction needed, has included this recipe in many cookbooks. My first time making French Onion Soup was from her book <em>The Way To Cook</em>. This dish is an all-time favorite of many people, French or otherwise. It is very much a comfort food, perfect for slow days in the cooler part of the year.</p>
    <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Heavy-bottomed 3 quart saucepan</li>
            <li>Wooden spoon</li>
            <li>Whisk</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbs Butter</li>
            <li>1 Tbs Light Olive Oil</li>
            <li>8 cups Onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Sugar</li>
            <li>2 1/2 quarts Beef Stock</li>
                <em>Heat 2 cups of stock</em>
            <li>4 to 5 Tbs Cognac</li>
            <li>1 cup dry, white Vermouth</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat butter and oil in saucepan over medium heat</li>
            <li>Once butter has melted, stir in the onions and cover the pan</li>
            <li>Cook onions slowly until tender and translucent (~10 minutes)</li>
            <li>Stir in salt and sugar, and bring heat up to medium-high</li>
                <em>Sugar will help onions brown</em>
            <li>Stir frequently until onions are a nice dark walnut color (~25-30 minutes)</li>
            <li>Once onions are browned, stir in flour and cook slowly (~3-4 minutes)</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and let cool for a moment</li>
            <li>Whisk in 2 cups of hot stock, mixing well</li>
            <li>Return to heat</li>
            <li>Add rest of the stock, Cognac, and Vermouth and bring to a simmer</li>
            <li>Cover loosely and let simmer very slowly for 90 minutes</li>
            <li>If liquid reduces too much add a little water</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and serve with bread and grated Swiss or Parmesan cheese</li>
                <em>Usually you'll see French Onion Soup served with bread in it and cheese melted over the top, Julia Child includes this as a separate thing, so I won't be including those steps</em>
